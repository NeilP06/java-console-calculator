# The Java Calculator!
📱 Java-made calculator that can be accessed in the terminal!

`Q: How do you use the Java Calculator?`
The code can be run through the terminal. Calculator.java > run (provided by my setup in VSC).

`Note: you would need to restart the terminal every time you would want to make a new calculation.`
